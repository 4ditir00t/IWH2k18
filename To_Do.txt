Basic web bit:

regd. pages - index, about, home, activity, story, settings

activity and story would be template - retrieve from database

settings would have a form that retrieves from the database and shows the details...
if they want to edit they could... but only the parent can access it.
As in the student can only send a mail to the parent to create changes and via link they can open?

index is the first page

home is the page after login, it will have the navigation to the activity and story

about is regd. project and us

Database bit:

reqd. 3

1 - login
2 - user details & progress
3 - activities & story details

Honestly, the settings is messed up. if you have a better idea go ahead
